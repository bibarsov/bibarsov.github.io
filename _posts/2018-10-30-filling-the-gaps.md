## Filling the gaps

Hi, folks! Today I've thought about the experience I have every day being an it-engineer. Maths, algorithms and data structures, other programming languages those aren't involved on a daily basis and tend to be forgotten over time. And I feel frustrated for that reason.

### Keep yourself fit!

Enterpise development world is so bloody and ruthless. By the time I became a skillful programmer I've forgotten some of my academic knowledge in computer science. Given that, I decided to do some repetition of what I learnt during studentship. Fortunately, there are so many free of charge resources:

* [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* [Stepik](https://stepik.org/catalog)
* [Coursera](https://coursera.org)
* [SQL Ex](http://www.sql-ex.ru/?Lang=1)

and many others! Just spend an hour for that every day and you'll be fine.
Enjoy it.
